// Use descriptive page titles (4:2)
//
// ** Create a descriptive, unique, and concise title for each webpage.**
//
// Title refers to the text that is in the browser title bar (this is the bar found at the very top of the browser screen). Titles are used by search engines to identify pages. If two or more pages have the same title, they cannot be differentiated by users or the 'Favorites' feature of the browser. If users bookmark a page, they should not have to edit the title to meet the characteristics mentioned above.
//
// Remember that some search engines only list the titles in their search results page. Use concise and meaningful titles on all pages to help orient users as they browse a page, or scan for specific URLs.
//
// To avoid confusing users, make the title that appears in the heading of the browser consistent with the title in the content area of the pages.
