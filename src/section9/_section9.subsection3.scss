// ** Use descriptive headings liberally throughout a Web site.**
//
// Well-written headings are an important tool for helping users scan quickly. Headings should conceptually relate to the information or functions that follow them.
//
// Headings should provide strong cues that orient users and inform them about page organization and structure. Headings also help classify information on a page. Each heading should be helpful in finding the desired target.

// The ability to scan quickly is particularly important for older adults because they tend to stop scanning and start reading more frequently. If headings are not descriptive or plentiful enough, the user may start reading in places that do not offer the information they are seeking, thereby slowing them down unnecessarily.
