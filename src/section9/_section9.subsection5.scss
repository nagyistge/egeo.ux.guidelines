// Highlight critical data (4:3)
//
// ** Visually distinguish (i.e., highlight) important page items that require user attention, particularly when those items are displayed infrequently.**
//
// Items to highlight might include recently changed data, data exceeding acceptable limits, or data failing to meet some other defined criteria. Highlight is used here in its general sense, meaning to emphasize or make prominent. Highlighting is most effective when used sparingly, i.e., highlighting just a few items on a page that is otherwise relatively uniform in appearance.
