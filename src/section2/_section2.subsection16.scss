// **Provide assistance for users who need additional help with the website.**
//
//Some users require special assistance. This is particularly important if the site was designed for inexperienced users or has many first time users. For example, in one website that was designed for repeat users, more than one-third of users (thirty-six percent) were first time visitors. A special link was prepared that allowed new users to access more information about the content of the site and described the best way to navigate the site.
