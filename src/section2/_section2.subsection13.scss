// Do not require users to multitask (3:4)
//
// **If reading speed is important, do not require users to perform other tasks while reading from the monitor.**
//
//Generally, users can read from a monitor as fast as they can from paper, unless they are required to perform other tasks that require human 'working memory' resources while reading. For example, do not require users to look at the information on one page and remember it while reading the information on a second page. This can reliably slow their reading performance.
