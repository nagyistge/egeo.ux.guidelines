// Warn users about "time outs" (4:3)
//
// **Let users know if a page is programmed to 'time out', and warn users before time expires so they can request additional time.**
//
//Some pages are designed to 'time out' automatically (usually because of security reasons). Pages that require users to use them within a fixed amount of time can present particular challenges to users who read or make entries slowly.
