// Use 'users terminology' in help documents (3:3)
//
// **Create ‘Help’ documentation using the 'users terminology' to describe elements and features.**
//
//Users have a colloquial understanding of website features, names and functions (e.g., breadcrumbs). Create 'Help' sections that address unfamiliar terms with the right amount of context. For example, if you refer to the 'navigation bar,' explain or highlight what you are referring. Remember that users and designers may use different terms to identify the same web features.
