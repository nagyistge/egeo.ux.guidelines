// Facilitate Scanning (5:4)
//
// ** Facilitate scanning by creating pages with clear well-placed headings, short phrases and sentences, and short paragraphs.**
//
// Text-dense pages can result in users missing information. Websites that are optimized for scanning help users find the desired information fast. To optimize a page, place important headings high in the center section of a page, so that users can scan until they find something of interest.
