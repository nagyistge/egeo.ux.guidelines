// Organize information clearly (5:4)
//
// **Organize information at each level of the Web site so that it shows a clear and logical structure to typical users.**
//
// Designers should present information in a structure that reflects user needs and the site’s goals. Information should be well-organized at the Web site level, page level, and paragraph or list level. Good Web site and page design enables users to understand the nature of the site’s organizational relationships and will support users in locating information efficiently. A clear, logical structure will reduce the chances of users becoming bored, disinterested, or frustrated.
