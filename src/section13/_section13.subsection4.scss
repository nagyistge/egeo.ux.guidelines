// Use media meaningfully (4:5)
//
// **Use video, animation, and audio only when they help to convey a website’s message.**
//
// Multimedia elements (e.g., animation) can add value to a website’s content, and help direct users to the most important information. However, used carelessly, they can also distract users, and dramatically slow download speeds. Use multimedia content productively so that it benefits the user.
