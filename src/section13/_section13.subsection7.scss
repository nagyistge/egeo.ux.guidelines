// Limit large images above the fold (4:3)

// **Do not fill the entire first screenful with one image if there are screensful of text information below the fold.**

// Large graphics that cover most of the screen at the top of the page suggest to users that there is no more information below the graphic. In one study, because a graphic filled the screen, some users did not use the scrollbar to scroll down to more content. In fact, some users did not even suspect that more information might be located below the fold.
