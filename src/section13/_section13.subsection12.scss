// Introduce Animation (2:3)
//
// **Provide an introductory explanation for animation prior to it being viewed.**
//
//Providing an explanation of animation before it begins will help users better integrate the animation and associated content. In other words, briefly explain to users what they are about to see before they see it. Also, allow animation to be user-controlled. The user should be able to pause, stop, replay, or ignore animation or other multimedia elements.
