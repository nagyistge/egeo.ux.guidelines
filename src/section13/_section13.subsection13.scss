// Emulate real-world objects (2:4)
//
// **Use images that look like real-world items when appropriate.**
//
// Images (e.g., pushbuttons and navigation tabs) are likely to be considered as links when they are designed to emulate their real-world analogues. If a designer cannot make such images emulate real-world objects, the image may require at least one additional clickability cue, such as a descriptive label (like ’Home’ or ’Next’) or placement on the page. A text label can help inform users about a link’s destination, but in one study some users missed this type of image link, even those that contained words, because the words were not underlined.
