// Use thumbnails to preview large images (2:2)
//
// **When viewing full-size images is not critical, first provide a thumbnail of the image.**
//
// By providing thumbnails of larger images, users can decide whether they want to wait for the full image to load. By using thumbnails, those who do not need or want to see the full image are not slowed down by large image downloads. Link the thumbnail image to the full-size copy.
