// Ensure that images do not slow download (4:4)

// **Take steps to ensure that images do not negatively impact download speeds.**
//
// Delays are frustrating to users. Strive to maintain download speeds to less than five seconds. To improve download speeds, use several small images rather than a single large image. Repeat images when possible, and save images with the “interlaced” or “progressive” option. Limit page sizes to less than 30,000 bytes. Minimize the number of different colors used in an image, and add pixel dimension tags (e.g., height and width) to the image reference. High Speed users may not notice anything different; however, these techniques will greatly improve download speeds for modem or hotspot users.
