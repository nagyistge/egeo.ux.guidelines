// Use images to facilitate learning (1:5)
//
// **To facilitate learning, use images rather than text whenever possible.**
//
// The superiority of pictures over text in a learning situation appears to be strong. For example, pictures of common objects are recognized and recalled better than their textual names. Exceptions seem to occur when the items are conceptually very similar (e.g., all animals or tools), or when items are presented so quickly that learners cannot create verbal labels.
