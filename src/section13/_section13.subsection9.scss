// Limit the use of images (3:2)
//
// **Use images only when they are critical to the success of a Web site.**
//
// Ensure that a Web site's graphics add value and increase the clarity of the information on the site. Certain graphics can make some Web sites much more interesting for users, and users may be willing to wait a few extra seconds for them to load. Users tend to be most frustrated if they wait several seconds for a graphic to download, and then find that the image does not add any value. Some decorative graphics are acceptable when they do not distract the user.
