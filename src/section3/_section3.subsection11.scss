// Provide frame titles (2:2)
//
// **To ensure accessibility, provide frame titles that facilitate frame identification and navigation.**
//
//Frames are used to divide the browser screen into separate areas, with each area presenting different, but usually related, information. For example, a designer may use a frame to place navigational links in the left page, and put the main information in a larger frame on the right side. This allows users to scroll through the information section without disturbing the navigation section. Clear and concise frame titles enable people with disabilities to properly orient themselves when frames are used.
