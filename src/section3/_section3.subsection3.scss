// Enable users to skip repetitive navigation links (4:2)
//
// **To aid those using assistive technologies, provide a means for users to skip repetitive navigation links.**
//
// Developers frequently place a series of routine navigational links at a standard location - usually across the top, bottom, or side of a page. For people using assistive devices, it can be a tedious and time-consuming task to wait for all of the repeated links to be read. Users should be able to avoid these links when they desire to do so.
