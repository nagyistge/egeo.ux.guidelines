// Ensure scripts allow accessibility (3:2)
//
// **When designing for accessibility, ensure that the information provided on pages that utilize scripting languages to display content or to create interface elements can be read by assistive technology.**

//Whenever a script changes the content of a page, the change must be indicated in a way that can be detected and read by a screen reader. Also, if mouseovers are used, ensure that they can be activated using a keyboard.
