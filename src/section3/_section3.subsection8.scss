// Use client-side image maps (3:3)
//
// **To improve accessibility, provide client-side image maps instead of server-side image maps.**
//
//Client-side image maps can be made fully accessible, whereas server-side image maps cannot be made accessible without employing a text alternative for each section of the map. To make client-side image maps accessible, assign alt text to each region within the map. Ensure that redundant text links are provided for each active region of a server-side image map.
