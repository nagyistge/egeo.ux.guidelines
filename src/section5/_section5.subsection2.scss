// Locate the primary navigation area in a highly noticeable place (5:2)
//
// **... preferably directly adjacent to the main body of the page**
//
// **Group items in the navigation area** so that similar items are next to each other. Grouping helps users differentiate among similar or related categories and see the breadth of products or content you offer. For example, group product categories for prescription medications and over-the-counter medications. Similarly, on an e-commerce site, all items related to shopping, such as the shopping cart, account information, and customer service should be in the same area.
//
// **Don't provide multiple navigation areas for the same type of links.** Groups that are too similar can fragment and complicate the interface, making the user work too hard to create order and meaning.
//
//**Use icons in navigation only if they help users to recognize a class of items immediately** , such as new items, sale items, or video content. Don't use icons when simple text links are clearly differentiable from each other, such as in category names. If you find that you need to ponder to come up with an icon for navigation, chances are it's not going to be easily recognizable or intuitive for users. For example, the icons for "Links" and "Forum" on Asia Cuisine don't help to further explain these categories or make them more immediately recognizable; they just clutter the page.
