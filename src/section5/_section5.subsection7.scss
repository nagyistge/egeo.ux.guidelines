// Home page length: People Scroll Today but only... (3:2)
//
// **...If they know that below the fold there are something interesting**
//
// Any element on the homepage that must immediately attract the attention of users should be placed 'above the fold' ex: call to action. Information that cannot be seen in the first screenful. But if users conclude that what they see on the visible portion of the page is not of interest, they may not bother scrolling to see the rest of the page.
//
// Some users take a long time to scroll down 'below the fold', indicating a reluctance to move from the first screenful to subsequent information. Older users and novices are more likely to miss information that is placed below the fold.
