// Limit home page length (3:2)
//
// **Limit the homepage to one screenful of information, if at all possible.**
//
// Any element on the homepage that must immediately attract the attention of users should be placed 'above the fold'. Information that cannot be seen in the first screenful may be missed altogether - this can negatively impact the effectiveness of the Web site. If users conclude that what they see on the visible portion of the page is not of interest, they may not bother scrolling to see the rest of the page.
//
// Some users take a long time to scroll down 'below the fold', indicating a reluctance to move from the first screenful to subsequent information. Older users and novices are more likely to miss information that is placed below the fold.
