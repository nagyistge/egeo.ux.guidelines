// Communicate the site's value and purpose (4:3)
//
// **Clearly and prominently communicate the purpose and value of the website on the homepage.**
//
// On average, users browsing or searching the Web spend little time on each website. Emphasize what the website offers that is of value to users, and how it differs from key competitors. This is important because many users misunderstand the purpose of a website.
//
// In some cases the purpose of a website is easily inferred. In other cases, it may need to be explicitly stated through the use of brief text or a tagline. Do not expect users to read a lot of text or navigate the website to determine its purpose.
