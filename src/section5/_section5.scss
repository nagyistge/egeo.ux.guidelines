// The Home Page
//
//The homepage is different from all other Web site pages. A well-constructed homepage will project a good first impression to all who visit the site.
//
//It is important to ensure that the homepage has all of the features expected of a homepage and looks like a homepage to users. A homepage should clearly communicate the site's purpose, and show all major options available on the Web site. Generally, the majority of the homepage should be visible ’above the fold,’ and should contain a limited amount of prose text. Designers should provide easy access to the homepage from every page in the site.
