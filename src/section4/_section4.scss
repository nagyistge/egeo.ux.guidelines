// Hardware and Software
//
// Designers are rarely free to do whatever comes to mind. Just as designers consider their users’ needs for specific information, they must also consider any constraints imposed on them by their users’ hardware, software, and speed of connection to the Internet. Today, a single operating system (Microsoft’s XP) dominates personal computer market. Similarly, only two Web site browsers are favored by the vast majority of users. More than ninety percent of users have their monitors set to 1024x768, 800x600 or 1280x1024 pixel resolution. And while most users at work have high-speed Internet access, many home users still connect using dial-up.

//Within the constraints of available time, money, and resources, it is usually impossible to design for all users. Therefore, identify the hardware and software used by your primary and secondary audiences and design to maximize the effectiveness of your Web site.
