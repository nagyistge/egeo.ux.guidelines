// Design for common screen resolutions (3:2)
//
// **Design for YOUR audience first, masses second.**
//
// Google dictates the ebb and flow of online commerce and they’ve just dictated you need to design for a good experience across multiple devices IF you want to rank well in Google. (http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com.es/2015/02/finding-more-mobile-friendly-search.html)
//
//At the moment – that essentially now means responsive website design.
//
//That could mean yes: design for a 1024×768 setting (for instance) BUT ALSO ensure it also looks good, or ‘transforms gracefully’, to the 800×600 setting, for example, or even smaller. 
//
//MOBILE IS ON THE RISE, so if developing a new website in 2015, you MUST think about how mobile friendly your website really is from the start.
//
//Your pages should work at any resolution. Jakob Nielsen is on record as recommending:
//
//* Optimise for 1024×768, which was the most widely used screen size for a long time. Of course, the general guideline is to optimise for your target audience’s most common resolution, so size will change in the future. It might even be a different size now, if, say, you’re designing an intranet for a company that gives all employees new big monitors.
//
//* Do not design solely for a specific monitor size unless you have been specifically commissioned to do so – because screen sizes vary among users. Window size variability is even greater, since users don’t always maximise their browsers (especially if they have large screens).
//
//* Use a liquid layout that stretches to the current user’s window size (that is, avoid frozen layouts that are always the same size).
