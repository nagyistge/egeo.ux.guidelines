// Design for common screen resolutions (3:2)
//
// **Design for monitors with the screen resolution set at 1024x768 pixels.**
//
// Designers should attempt to accommodate ninety-five percent of all users. As of June 2006, 56% of users have their screen resolution set at 1024x768. By designing for 1024x768, designers will accommodate this most common resolution, as well as those at any higher resolution. Ensure that all testing of Web sites is done using the most common screen resolutions.
