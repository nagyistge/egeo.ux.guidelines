// Involve users in establishing user requirements (5:3)
//
// **Involve users to improve the completeness and accuracy of user requirements.**
//
//One of the basic principles of user-centered design is the early and continual focus on users. For this reason, user involvement has become a widely accepted principle in the development of usable systems. Involving users has the most value when trying to improve the completeness and accuracy of user requirements. It is also useful in helping to avoid unused or little-used system features. Users are most valuable in helping designers know what a system should do, but not in helping designers determine how best to have the system do it.
