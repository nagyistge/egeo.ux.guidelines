// Use parallel design (2:4)
//
// **Have several developers independently propose designs and use the best elements from each design.**
//
//Do not rely on the ideas of a single designer. The best approach is parallel design, where designers independently evaluate the design issues and propose solutions. Attempt to saturate the design space before selecting the ideal solution. The more varied and independent the ideas that are considered, the better the final product will be.
