//Users define 'usability' as their perception of how consistent, efficient, productive, organized, easy to use, intuitive, and straightforward it is to accomplish tasks within a system. It is important for designers to develop an understanding of their users expectations through task analyses and other research. Users can have expectations based on their prior knowledge and past experience.
