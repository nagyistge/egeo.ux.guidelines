// Set Usability Goals (3:3)
//
// **Set performance goals that include success rates and the time it takes users to find specific information, or preference goals that address satisfaction and acceptance by users.**
//
//Setting user performance and/or preference goals helps developers build better Web sites. It can also help make usability testing more effective. For example, some intranet Web sites have set the goal that information will be found eighty percent of the time and in less than one minute.
