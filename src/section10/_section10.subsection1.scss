// Use Meaningful Link Labels (5:4)
//
// ** Use link labels and concepts that are meaningful, understandable, and easily differentiated by users rather than designers.**
//
// To avoid user confusion, use link labels that clearly differentiate one link from another. Users should be able to look at each link and learn something about the link's destination. Using terms like 'Click Here' can be counterproductive.
//
// Clear labeling is especially important as users navigate down through the available links. The more decisions that users are required to make concerning links, the more opportunities they have to make a wrong decision.
