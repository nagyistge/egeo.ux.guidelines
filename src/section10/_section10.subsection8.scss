// Provide Consistent Clickability Cues (3:2)
//
// **Provide sufficient cues to clearly indicate to users that an item is clickable.**
//
// Create links so that users do not have to rely on ‘mouse-overs’ to determine if a text is clickable. Use underline, bullets, arrows, and other symbols consistently to indicate clickable items. Avoid using images as links. Clickable images force the user to study the image and discern whether or not it is clickable. Items that are in the top center of the page, or left and right panels have a high probability of being considered links.
