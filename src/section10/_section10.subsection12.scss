//  Indicate Internal vs. External Links (3:2)
//
// ** Indicate to users when a link will move them to a different location on the same page or to a new page on a different Web site.**
//
// One study showed that users tend to assume that links will take them to another page within the same Web site. When this assumption is not true, users can become confused. Designers should try to notify users when they are simply moving down a page, or leaving the site altogether.
