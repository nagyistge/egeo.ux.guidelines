// Match Link Names with Their Destination Pages (4:4)
//
// ** Make the link text consistent with the title or headings on the destination (i.e., target) page**
//
// Closely matched links and destination targets help provide the necessary feedback to users that they have reached the intended page.
//
// If users will have to click more than once to get to a specific target destination, avoid repeating the exact same link wording over and over because users can be confused if the links at each level are identical or even very similar. In one study, after users clicked on a link entitled 'First Aid', the next page had three options. One of them was again titled 'First Aid'. The two 'First Aid' links went to different places. Users tended to click on another option on the second page because they thought that they had already reached 'First Aid'.
