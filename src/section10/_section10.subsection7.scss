// Designate Used Links (4:2)
//
// **Use color changes to indicate to users when a link has been visited.**
//
// Link colors help users understand which parts of a website they have visited, and can increase usersâ€™ ability to find information. Use default text link colors such as blue for unvisited links, and purple for visited links. Ensure that all links sharing the same target (e.g., external websites) change colors as well.
