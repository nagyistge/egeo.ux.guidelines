// Clarify Clickable Regions of Images (3:3)
//
// ** If any part of an image is clickable, ensure that the entire image is clickable or that the clickable sections are obvious.**
//
// Users should not be required to use the mouse pointer to discover clickable areas of images. For example, in a map of the United States, if individual states are clickable, sufficient cues should be given to indicate the clickable states.
