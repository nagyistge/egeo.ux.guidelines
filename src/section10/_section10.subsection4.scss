// Avoid Misleading Cues to Click (4:2)
//
// **Ensure that items that are not clickable do not have characteristics that suggest that they are clickable.**
//
// Symbols usually must be combined with at least one other cue that suggests clickability. In one study, users were observed to click on a major heading with some link characteristics, but the heading was not actually a link.
//
// However, to some users bullets and arrows may suggest clickability, even when they contain no other clickability cues (underlining, blue coloration, etc.). This slows users as they debate whether the items are links.
