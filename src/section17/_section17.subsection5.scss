//  Consider frequency and severity (3:3)
//
// ** Distinguish between frequency and severity when reporting on usability issues and problems.**
//
// The number of users affected determines the frequency of a problem. To be most useful, the severity of a problem should be defined by analyzing difficulties encountered by individual users. Both frequency and severity data can be used to prioritize usability issues that need to be changed. For example, designers should focus first on fixing those usability issues that were shown to be most severe. Those usability issues that were encountered by many participants, but had a severity rating of 'nuisance', should be given much less priority.
