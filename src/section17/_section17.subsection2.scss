//  Solicit comments from test participants (3:4)

// ** Solicit usability testing participants' comments either during or after the performance of tasks.**
//
// Solicit comments from test participants by asking participants to think aloud when performing tasks, or report opinions after completed tasks (retrospectively). The ‘think aloud’ method allows participants to report incidents as they happen, but may result in fewer completed tasks, and fewer negative reports. The retrospective method allows participants to report ‘critical incidents’ after viewing their session on video. Both methods can result in positive biased reviews.
