// Use the appropriate prototyping technology (2:3)

// **Create prototypes using the most appropriate technology for the phase of the design, the required fidelity of the prototype, and skill of the person creating the prototype.**
//
// Designers can use either paper-based or computer-based prototypes. Paper-based prototyping appears to be as effective as computer-based prototyping when trying to identify most usability issues. Several studies have shown that there was no reliable difference in the number of usability issues detected between computer and paper prototypes. However, usability test participants usually prefer interacting with computer-based prototypes. Paper prototypes can be used when it is necessary to view and evaluate many different (usually early) design ideas, or when computer-based prototyping does not support the ideas the designer wants to implement, or when all members of the design team need to be included–even those that do not know how to create computer-based prototypes. 
//
//Software tools that are available to assist in the rapid development of prototypes include PowerPoint, Visio, including other HTML base tools. PowerPoint can be used to create medium fidelity prototypes. These prototypes can be both interactive and dynamic, and are useful when the design requires more than a ’pencil-and-paper’ prototype.
