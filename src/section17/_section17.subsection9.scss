// Recognize the "evaluator effect" (2:4)
//
// **Beware of the 'evaluator' effect when conducting inspection evaluations.**
//
// The ’evaluator effect’ occurs when multiple evaluators evaluating the same interface detect markedly different sets of problems. The evaluators may be doing an expert review, heuristic evaluation, or cognitive walkthrough. The evaluator effect exists for evaluators who are novice or experienced, while detecting cosmetic and severe problems, and when evaluating simple or complex websites. In fact, when using multiple evaluators, any one evaluator is unlikely to detect the majority of the ’severe’ problems that will be detected collectively by all evaluators. Evaluators also tend to perceive the problems they detected as more severe than the problems detected by others.
