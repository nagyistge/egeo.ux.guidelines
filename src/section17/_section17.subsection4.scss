// Prioritize tasks (3:2)
//
// **Give high priority to usability issues preventing 'easy' tasks from being easy.**
//
// When deciding which usability issues to fix first, address the tasks that users believe to be easy but are actually difficult. The Usability Magnitude Estimation (UME) is a measure that can be used to assess user expectations of the difficulty of each task. Participants judge how difficult or easy a task will be before trying to do it, and then make a second judgment after trying to complete the task. Each task is eventually put into one of four categories based on these expected versus actual ratings:
//
// * Tasks that were expected to be easy, but were actually difficult;
//
// * Tasks that were expected to be difficult, but were actually easy;
//
// * Tasks that were expected to be easy and were actually easy; and
//
// * Tasks that were expected to be difficult and were difficult to complete.
