// Use an iterative design approach (4:5)
//
// **Develop and test prototypes through an iterative design approach to create the most useful and usable Web site.**
//
//  Iterative design consists of creating paper or computer prototypes, testing the prototypes, and then making changes based on the test results. The ’test and make changes’ process is repeated until the website meets performance benchmarks (usability goals). When these goals are met, the iterative process ends. The iterative design process helps to substantially improve the usability of websites, improve task completion rates, and improve user satisfaction.
