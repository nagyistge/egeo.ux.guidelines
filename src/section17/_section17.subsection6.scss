// Select the right number of test participants (3:4)
//
// **Select the right number of participants when using different usability techniques. Using too few may reduce the usability of a Web site; using too many wastes valuable resources.**
//
//Selecting the number of participants to use when conducting usability evaluations depends on the method being used:
//
//Inspection evaluation by usability specialists:
//
// * The typical goal of an inspection evaluation is to have usability experts separately inspect a user interface by applying a set of broad usability guidelines. This is usually done with two to five people. 
//
// * The research shows that as more experts are involved in evaluating the usability of the product, the greater the number of usability issues will be identified. However, for every true usability problem identified, there will be at least one usability issue that is not a real problem. Having more evaluators does decrease the number of misses, but is also increases the number of false positives. Generally, the more expert the usability specialists, the more useful the results.
//
// Performance usability testing with users:
//
// * Early in the design process, usability testing with a small number of users (approximately six) is sufficient to identify problems with the information architecture (navigation) and overall design issues. If the Web site has very different types of users (e.g., novices and experts), it is important to test with six or more of each type of user. Another critical factor in this preliminary testing is having trained usability specialists as the usability test facilitator and primary observers.
//
// * Once the navigation, basic content, and display features are in place, quantitative performance testing (measuring times, wrong pathways, failure to find content, etc.) can be conducted to ensure that usability objectives are being met. To measure each usability objective to a particular confidence level, such as ninety-five percent, requires a larger number of users in the usability tests.
//
// * When the performance of two sites is compared (i.e., an original site and a revised site), quantitative usability testing should be employed. Depending on how confident the usability specialist wants to be in the tests could require a larger number of participants.
//
// * It is best to perform iterative cycles of usability testing over the course of the Web siteâ€™s development. This enables usability specialists and designers to observe and listen to many users.
