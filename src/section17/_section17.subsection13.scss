// **Use severity ratings with caution.**
//
//Most designers would like usability specialists to prioritize design problems that they found either by inspection evaluations or expert reviews. So that they can decide which issues to fix first, designers would like the list of potential usability problems ranked by each ones severity level. The research literature is fairly clear that even highly experienced usability specialists cannot agree on which usability issues will have the greatest impact on usability.
//
//One study had 17 expert review and usability test teams evaluate and test the same Web page. The teams had one week to do an expert review, or two weeks to do a usability test. Each team classified each usability issue as a minor problem, serious problem, or critical problem. There was considerable disagreement in which problems the teams judged as minor, serious or critical, and there was little agreement on which were the top five problems. Another study reported that heuristic evaluators overestimated severity twenty-two percent of the time, and underestimated severity seventy-eight percent of the time when compared with usability testing results.
