// **Use inspection evaluation results with caution.**
//
// Inspection evaluations include heuristic evaluations, expert reviews, and cognitive walkthroughs. It is a common practice to conduct an inspection evaluation to try to detect and resolve obvious problems before conducting usability tests. Inspection evaluations should be used cautiously because several studies have shown that they appear to detect far more potential problems than actually exist, and they also tend to miss some real problems. On average, for every hit there will be about 1.3 false positives and .5 misses.
//
// Another recent study concluded that the low effectiveness of heuristic evaluations as a whole was worrisome because of the low problem detection rate (p=.09), and the large number of evaluators required (16) to uncover seventy-five percent of the potential usability issues.
//
// Another difficulty when conducting heuristic evaluations is that evaluators frequently apply the wrong heuristic, which can mislead designers that are trying to fix the problem. One study reported that only thirty-nine percent of the heuristics were appropriately applied. 
//
// Evaluators seem to have the most success identifying usability issues that can be seen by merely looking at the display, and the least success finding issues that require users to take several steps (clicks) to a target.
//
// Heuristic evaluations and expert reviews may best be used to identify potential usability issues to evaluate during usability testing. To improve somewhat on the performance of heuristic evaluations, evaluators can use the ’usability problem inspector’ (UPI) method or the ’Discovery and Analysis Resource’ (DARe) method.
