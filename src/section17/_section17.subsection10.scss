// Apply automatic evaluation methods (1:3)
//
// **Use appropriate automatic evaluation methods to conduct initial evaluations on Web sites.**
//
// An automatic evaluation method is one where software is used to evaluate a Web site. An automatic evaluation tool can help find certain types of design difficulties, such as pages that will load slowly, missing links, use of jargon, potential accessibility problems, etc. While automatic evaluation methods are useful, they should not be used as a substitute for evaluations or usability testing with typical users. There are many commercially available automatic evaluation methods available for checking on a variety of Web site parameters.
