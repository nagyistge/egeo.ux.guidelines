// Choosing a testing venue (1:4)
//
// **Testers can use either laboratory or remote usability testing because they both elicit similar results.**
//
//In laboratory-based testing, the participant and the tester are in the same physical location. In remote testing, the tester and the participant are in different physical locations. Remote testing provides the opportunity for participants to take a test in their home or office. It is convenient for participants because it requires no travel to a test facility.
