// Avoid scroll stoppers (3:4)
//
// **Ensure that the location of headings and other page elements does not create the illusion that users have reached the top or bottom of a page when they have not.**
//
// In one study, three headings were positioned in the center of a page below a section of introductory text - the headings were located about one inch below the navigation tabs. When users scrolled up the page from the bottom and encountered these headings, they tended to stop, thinking the headings indicated the top of the page.
//
// Similarly, users have been found to not scroll to the true bottom of a page to find a link because they encountered a block of text in a very small font size. This small type led users to believe that they were at the true bottom of the page. Other elements that may stop users' scrolling include horizontal lines, inappropriate placement of 'widgets', and cessation of background color.
