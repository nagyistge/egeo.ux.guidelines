//  Use frames when content must remain accessible (1:4)
//
// **Use frames when certain functions must remain visible on the screen as the user accesses other information on the site.**
//
// It works well to have the functional items in one frame and the items that are being acted upon in another frame. This is sometimes referred to as a 'simultaneous menu' because making changes in one frame causes the information to change in another frame. Side-by-side frames seem to work best, with the functions on the left and the information viewing area on the right.
//
// Keep in mind that frames can be confusing to some users. More than three frames on a page can be especially confusing to infrequent and occasional users. Frames also pose problems when users attempt to print, and when they search pages.
