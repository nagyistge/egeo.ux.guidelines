// Use moderate white space (3:4)
//
// **Limit the amount of white space (areas without text, graphics, etc.) on pages that are used for scanning and searching.**
//
// ’Density’ is the percentage of the screen filled with text and graphics. One study found that higher density is related to faster scanning, and has no impact on user accuracy or preference. Another study found that users prefer moderate amounts of white space, but the amount of white space has no impact on their searching performance. On content (i.e., text) pages, use some white space to separate paragraphs. Too much separation of items on webpages may require users to scroll unnecessarily.
