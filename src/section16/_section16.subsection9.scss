// Use radio-buttons for mutually exclusive selections (3:4)
//
// **Provide radio buttons when users need to choose one response from a list of mutually exclusive options.**
//
// Radio buttons should be used when there is a need to select from among mutually exclusive items. Users should be able to click on the button or its text label to make their selection. Assign one of the radio button choices as the default when appropriate. One study reported that for making mutually exclusive selections, radio buttons elicit reliably better performance than drop-down lists. Radio buttons are also preferred over both open lists and drop-down lists.
