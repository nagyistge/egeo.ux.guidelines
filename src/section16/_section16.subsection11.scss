// **Use the computer to detect errors made by users.**
//
// Do not expect that users always will make correct entries. Anticipate possible user errors, and when possible, allocate responsibility to the computer to identify these mistakes and suggest corrections. For example, if a date is entered as ’February 31,’ the computer should generate an error message asking for a revised entry. Design the site’s search engine (and other places where users enter data) to accommodate common misspellings and certain other errors.
