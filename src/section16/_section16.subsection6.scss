// Minimize User Data Entry (4:3)
//
// **Do not require users to enter data more than once. Example: for billing and shipping address, provide a method for using the same address for both and require the user to enter it only once.**
//
//Another example (a login that remembers the user's login name in the future) implies that it is a good practice to reference user data to pre-populate form fields or render them unnecessary.
