// Use familiar widgets (3:3)
//
// **Use widgets that are familiar to your users, and employ them in their commonly used manner.**
//
// Unfamiliar widgets will slow some users, and cause others not to use the widget because they do not know how to make it work properly. For instance, one study showed that some users, particularly older users, do not know how to use a drop-down list. In choosing widgets, designers typically consider such issues as the amount of available screen ’real estate,’ reducing the number of user clicks, and whether the user will be choosing one from among many items, or several items at once. Usability test the performance and acceptability of widgets to ensure they do not confuse or slow users.
