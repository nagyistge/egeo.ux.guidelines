// Prioritize Buttons (3:3)
//
// ** Use location and highlighting to prioritize pushbuttons.**
//
// Place the most frequently used pushbutton in first position and set it to default, so that the ‘Enter’ key activates the pushbutton. Place the button most likely to be clicked on the left side of a two-button set of pushbuttons. Generally, users look to the left and then the right button before making a selection.
