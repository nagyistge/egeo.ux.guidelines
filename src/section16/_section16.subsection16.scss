// Label units of measurement (3:3)
//
// ** When using data entry fields, specify the desired measurement units with the field labels rather than requiring users to enter them.**
//
// Designers should include units such as minutes, ounces, or centimeters, etc. as part of the data entry field label. This will reduce the number of keystrokes required of users (speeding the data entry process), and reduce the chance of errors.
