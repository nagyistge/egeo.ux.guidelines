//  Provide auto-tabbing functionality (2:3)
//
// **Provide auto-tabbing functionality for frequent users with advanced Web interaction skills.**
//
//Auto-tabbing can significantly reduce data entry times for frequent users by not requiring them to manually tab from field to field.
//
//Caution should be used when implementing auto-tabbing to be sure that it will not harm users who do not have technologies (e.g. JavaScript) enabled or who are using assistive technologies. Once the user has completed the form, the form should return keyboard focus back to the parent window.
//
//When the auto-tabbing is disabled, users should be able to manually move to the next field using keystrokes or their mouse.
