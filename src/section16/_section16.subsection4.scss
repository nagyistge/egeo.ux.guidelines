// Do Not Make User-Entered Codes Case Sensitive  (4:2)
//
// **Treat upper- and lowercase letters as equivalent when users are entering codes.**
//
// Do not make user-entered codes case sensitive unless there is a valid reason for doing so (such as increased security of passwords). If required, clearly inform users if they must enter codes in a case specific manner. When retaining data entered by users, show the data as it was entered by the user.
