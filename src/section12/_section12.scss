// Lists
//
// Lists are commonly found on Web sites.
//
//These may be lists of, for example, people, drugs, theaters, or restaurants. Each list should be clearly introduced and have a descriptive title. A list should be formatted so that it can be easily scanned. The order of items in the list should be done to maximize user performance, which usually means that the most important items are placed toward the top of the list. If a numbered list is used, start the numbering at ‘one,’ not ‘zero.’ Generally only the first letter of the first word is capitalized, unless a word that is usually capitalized is shown in the list.
