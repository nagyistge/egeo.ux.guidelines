// Order elements to maximize performance (4:5)
//
// **Arrange lists and tasks in an order that best facilitates efficient and successful user performance.**
//
// Designers should determine if there is an order for items that will facilitate use of the Web site. If there is, ensure that the site is formatted to support that order, and that all pages follow the same order. For example, ensure that lists of items, sets of links, and a series of tabs are in a meaningful order.
//
// Where no obvious order applies, organize lists alphabetically or numerically. Keep in mind that it is the user's logic that should prevail rather than the designer's logic.
