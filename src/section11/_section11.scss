// Text Appearance
//
// There are several issues related to text characteristics that can help ensure a Web site communicates effectively with users:
//
//- Use familiar fonts that are at least 12-points;
//- Use black text on plain, high-contrast backgrounds; and
//- Use background colors to help users understand the grouping of related information.
//
//Even though it is important to ensure visual consistency, steps should be taken to emphasize important text. Commonly used headings should be formatted consistently, and attention-attracting features, such as animation, should only be used when appropriate.
