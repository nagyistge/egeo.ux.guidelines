// Use dark text on plain, high-contrast backgrounds (4:5)
//
// ** When users are expected to rapidly read and understand prose text, use black text on a plain, high-contrast, non-patterned background.**
//
// Black text on a plain background elicited reliably faster reading performance than on a medium-textured background. When compared to reading light text on a dark background, people read black text on a white background up to thirty-two percent faster. In general, the greater the contrast between the text and background, the easier the text is to read.
