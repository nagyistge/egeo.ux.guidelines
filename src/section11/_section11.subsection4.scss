// **Ensure visual consistency of website elements within and between webpages.**
//
// Visual consistency is the consistent use of design elements such as typography, layout, colors, icons, navigation, images, and backgrounds. While users can overcome certain inconsistencies (e.g., entry fields, pushbuttons), consistent interfaces can reduce errors and task completion times. It can also reduce learning curves, and increase user satisfaction.
