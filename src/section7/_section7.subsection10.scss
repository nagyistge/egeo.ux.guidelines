// Use site maps (2:4)
//
// **Use site maps for Web sites that have many pages.**
//
// Site maps provide an overview of the Web site. They may display the hierarchy of the Web site, may be designed to resemble a traditional table of contents, or may be a simple index.
//
// Some studies suggest that site maps do not necessarily improve user's mental representations of a Web site. Also, one study reported that if a site map does not reflect user's (or the domains) conceptual structure, then the utility of the map is lessened. One study showed that only 7% of users turned to the sitemap when asked to learn about the site's structure.
