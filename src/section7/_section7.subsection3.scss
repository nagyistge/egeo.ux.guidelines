// Use a list of contents on long pages (4:3)
//
// **On long pages, provide a 'list of contents' with links that take users to the corresponding content farther down the page.**
//
// For longer pages with multiple content sections, create a short and clickable list of the sections at the top of the page. These are often called ‘Anchors.’ Anchors provide a preview of the content, so users can determine if the page contains the desired information. Anchors also provide quick access to the information. Create a heading for the anchors (e.g., On this page…) to notify users that the links will go to other parts of the page. At the end of each section, create 'back to top' links. To ensure accessibility, prevent pages from refreshing when users select an anchor link, and do not include a time and date stamp on a page with anchor links.
