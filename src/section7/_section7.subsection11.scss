// Glosses for navigational assistance (1:2)
//
// **Provide glosses to help users select correct links.**
//
// 'Glosses' are short phrases of information that pop up when a user places his or her mouse pointer over a link. A 'gloss' provides a preview of the type of information that will be found behind a link. Users prefer the preview information to be located close to the link, but not placed such that it gets in the way of reading the link. A gloss can be created by defining the Title attribute for a link. However, designers should not rely on the 'gloss' to compensate for poorly labeled links.
