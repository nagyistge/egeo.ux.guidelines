// Keep navigation pages short (2:4)
//
// **Do not require users to scroll purely navigational pages.**
//
// Ideally, navigation-only pages should contain no more than one screenful of information. Users should not need to scroll the page, even a small distance. One study showed that users considered the bottom of one screenful as the end of a page, and they did not scroll further to find additional navigational options.
