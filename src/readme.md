# Introduction

## Welcome to the Egeo official UX Guidelines documentation. 

### How to Get Involved

Updating the guidelines involves extensive research and review. If you would like to be involved, or if you would just like to offer suggestions for topics or evidence for inclusion, contact us at [ux@stratio.com](mailto:ux@stratio.com)


## Strength of Evidence
The ’Strength of Evidence’ ratings were revised for those guidelines
where new research was reported. In this case, 13 usability professionals
rated each of the new and revised guidelines, and assigned ’Strength of
Evidence’ ratings. The raters all were very familiar the research literature,
all had conducted their own studies, and there was a high level of
agreement in their ratings. The criteria used for
making the ’Strength of Evidence’ estimates is shown below:

#### The 'Relative Importance' of Each Guideline showing  1 to 5

To determine the 'Relative importance' of each guideline, 16 external reviewers were recruited. Half of these reviewers were Web site designers and half were usability specialists. Each reviewer evaluated each guideline and assigned a rating based on the question, 'How important is this guideline to the success of a Web site?' Those guidelines that were rated as having little importance to the success of a Web site were eliminated.

#### The 'Strength of Evidence' for Each Guideline showing  1 to 5

A group of eight usability researchers, practitioners and authors were recruited to generate a 'Strength of Evidence' rating for each guideline. These reviewers were all published researchers with doctoral degrees, experienced peer reviewers, and knowledgeable of experimental design. These reviewers constructed a set of criteria for judging the strength of the evidence for each guideline, which was used as the 'Strength of Evidence' scale.

### **5 – Strong Research Support  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]**

Cumulative and compelling, supporting research-based evidence
At least one formal, rigorous study with contextual validity
No known conflicting research-based findings
Expert opinion agrees with the research

### **4 – Moderate Research Support     [1, 2, 3, 4,**5]

Cumulative research-based evidence
There may or may not be conflicting research-based findings
Expert opinion
Tends to agree with the research, and
A consensus seems to be building

### **3 – Weak Research Support     [1, 2, 3,** 4, 5]

Limited research-based evidence
Conflicting research-based findings may exist - and/or -
There is mixed agreement of expert opinions

### **2 – Strong Expert Opinion Support     [1, 2,** 3, 4, 5]

No research-based evidence
Experts tend to agree, although there may not be a consensus
Multiple supporting expert opinions in textbooks, style guides, etc.
Generally accepted as a ’best practice’ or reflects ’state of practice’

### **1 – Weak Expert Opinion Support    **[1,  2, 3, 4, 5]

No research-based evidence
Limited or conflicting expert opinion
