// Communicate what is being searched (5:3)
//
// ** Design search engines to search the entire site, or clearly communicate which part of the site will be searched.**
//
// Designers may want to allow users to control the range of their searches. However, users tend to believe that a search engine will search the entire Web site. Do not have search engines search only a portion of the site without clearly informing users which parts of the site are being searched.
//
// Keep in mind that what a designer may consider to be the entirety of a site may not be the same as what the user thinks is the ’whole’ site. For example, many large sites have various subsections that are maintained by different designers, so the user may think of a site as something that designers think of as several sites. Make sure it is clear to users what part(s) of the Web site are being searched. Provide a means for users to narrow the scope of searches on large Web sites by providing easy access to specific subsites when searching.
