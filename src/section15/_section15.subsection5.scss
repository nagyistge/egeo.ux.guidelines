// Design search around user's terms (4:3)
//
// ** Construct a website's search engine to respond to users' terminology.**
//
// Users seem to rely on certain preferred keywords when searching. They will generally conduct one or two searches before trying another site or search engine (or abandoning the search altogether). 
//
// Determining the keywords users are using may require considerable data collection. Designers should make use of search engine logs, surveys, and other techniques to determine the preferred search words for their site, and make information relevant to those terms easy to find through the site’s search engine. Keep in mind that designers’ preferred keywords may not match users’ preferred keywords, and content writers may overestimate the specialized vocabulary of their audience. For the most common searches, provide a ’best bets’ set of results. Ensure that the ’best bets’ do not appear as advertising or paid links.
//
// In addition to responding to users’ keywords, design the site’s search engine to accommodate common misspellings, extra spaces, alternative punctuation, misused plurals, and other common user search errors.
