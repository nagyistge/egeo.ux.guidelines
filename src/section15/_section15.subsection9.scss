// Provide search templates (2:3)

// **Provide templates to facilitate the use of search engines.**
//
// Search templates assist users in formulating better search queries. A template consists of predefined keywords that help users select their search terms. The keywords can be used directly, or can help users formulate their own queries. Each template should be organized as a hierarchy of predefined keywords that could help to restrict the users’ initial search sets, and improve the relevance of the returned ’hits.’
