//  Include hints to improve performance (3:3)

// **Include specific hints to improve search performance.**
//
// One study found a direct link between the content of search hints and task effectiveness. When syntactic information was included in the search hint, participants achieved significantly greater syntactic performance. When semantic information was included in the search hint, participants achieved significantly greater semantic performance. In addition, participantsâ€™ confidence that their queries would retrieve the correct answer was reliably enhanced by the presence of semantic search hints (but not syntactic hints). The presence of examples improved semantic performance, but had no effect on syntactic performance. When hints contained more than one type of information (syntactic, semantic, or examples), performance was generally lower than when only one hint type was presented. Also, participants were able to complete the search tasks faster when only one hint was presented.
